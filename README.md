  ## Installation
  To install this project, create a local copy on your device and run "npm i" to install necessary dependencies.  You will have to have Node.js on your machine to run this program, as it uses node packages like Express.js.  Once installed, run the command "npm start" to initialize the server and create the "Social Butterfly" database with MongoDB.  Your console should log success messages for both of these events.  I recommend using an application like Insomnia to run and test the routes, as no front end exists for this application.

  ## Deployment
  N/A (No deployed application)

  ## Usage
  Create thoughts and responses in a local database to emulate a social network functionality with MongoDB
